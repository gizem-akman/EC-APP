# E-coupon Distribution Application (EC-APP)

The files uploaded in this repository are the formal verification and proof of concept of the protocol proposed in the paper with the title "Anonymous Location-Based Advertising with Fine-Grained Statistics", by Gizem Akman, Kuan Eeik Tan, and Valtteri Niemi, which is accepted to the 12th International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy (ICISSP 2026).

The authors of the paper thank Mohamed Taoufiq Damir for his help in making the paper possible.

## Proof of Concept

The implementation is done using Python and consists of seven scripts:

- **Issuer.py:** Performing the E-coupon issuer’s operations.
- **Client.py:** Illustrating the process at the client.
- **PS.py:** The Proximity Service (PS) at the shop.
- **Ecoupon.py:** A module for customized functions dedicated to the relevant functions in our
context.
- **DataGen.py:** A script for generating e-coupons data.
- **Stats.py:** For the statistics relevant to the advertisement conversion rate.

The video demonstration of the proof of concept can be found in this [link](https://mega.nz/file/CQUXDSAC#m6b4_zKJACLJ0tmj2qNVPJ42kXrY9Lal_NPYGzgW2KY). 

More detailed description can be found in the file _POC.pdf_ in the Proof of Concept folder.

## Formal verification

Formal verification of the protocol is done by using the ProVerif tool. We provide two codes for the model of the protocol:

- **Ecoupon.pv:** Proving the secrecy and authentication.
- **EcouponObsEq.pv:** Proving observational equivalence.

   
## ProVerif

ProVerif is a state-of-the-art tool for formal verification of symbolic modeling and analysis of security protocols. It uses Dolev-Yao as an adversary model. ProVerif uses the applied pi-calculus as a formal language and translates the protocol into a set of Horn clauses. Then, it tries to conclude if some security property is falsified, i.e., finds an attack.
